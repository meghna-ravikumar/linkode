# Linkode

Linkode is a casual platform designed to help programmers discover and connect with like-minded peers. Much like dating apps such as Tinder or Bumble, users can swipe to choose between 'Connect' or 'Crash' to initiate interactions with other programmers. The platform matches individuals based on simple criteria, making it easy for programmers to find others with similar interests, skill sets, or goals.

## Features

- **Simple Profile Matching:** Users are presented with a potential connection's profile and can choose to either 'Connect' or 'Crash' based on their interest. This approach ensures that interactions happen only when there is mutual interest.
  
- **Minimalist Design:** The interface is intentionally clean and free of distractions, focusing only on what matters most—connecting with other programmers.
  
- **AND GATE Matching:** The system uses a basic AND GATE logic for matching, ensuring that both users have overlapping interests before a connection is made.

- **Interest-based Discovery:** Whether you're looking for project collaboration, learning new programming languages, or networking, Linkode helps you discover like-minded individuals who share your passion.

- **Seamless Experience:** The app is optimized for a smooth, user-friendly experience, allowing programmers to quickly engage without unnecessary hurdles.

## Why use this?

Linkode is the ideal platform for programmers who want to connect with others in a straightforward, no-frills manner. Whether you're seeking collaboration, advice, or networking opportunities, Linkode cuts through the noise of larger social platforms. It’s a casual and focused environment where only relevant connections matter, so you won’t be distracted by unrelated content. If you're looking to expand your network of like-minded programmers, Linkode is the best place to start.

## Why we built this?

We noticed that existing platforms, like LinkedIn, are often overloaded with irrelevant content and clutter, making it difficult to focus on finding people who share specific programming interests. Linkode was built to solve this problem by providing a minimalist, easy-to-use platform where programmers can connect with one another based purely on shared passions and skills. By removing unnecessary distractions, Linkode offers a more focused, meaningful way to meet fellow coders.
